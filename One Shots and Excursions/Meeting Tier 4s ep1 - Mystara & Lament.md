## Heading to Mystara

Ted, Soren and Erky hop on the spelljammer and have Tumsy take them towards the planet Mystara in search of the tier 4 entity Dante Shadowblade. 

Doing some flyovers, they find the location in the Broken Lands where the tier 4 they are in search of likely is. It is a group of what seem to be apartment buildings and one office building just off of the shore in a town called Corunglain. The travelers decide to land on the beach.

After landing, they encounter a man heading up and down the beach with a metal detector. They ask after Dante's whereabouts and the gentleman says he never heard of him before, but he knows of a person with a similar last name. 

The group heads toward the office building and they realize that the complex of buildings is a large retirement community. They walk into the office building and there is a man behind the desk with quite an emo look about him described as "Tom Delonge, but dressed up a bit with a nice sea green polo."

The travelers enquire about the cost of the apartments/living spaces and ask to see a unit. One of the employees comes out and ask to talk to Tom and pulls him aside. Ted is able to perceive that some occupants have died in their units. Tom needs to take care of those matters, but agrees to show the travelers to a unit to look around while he attends to them. 

After getting into the unit, Erky makes his way to the bathroom mirror and casts Scrying to see what Tom is up to. He is taking care of the people in the room and casting a spell over their bodies, which turns out to be Gentle Repose. After casting the spells, he begins to head back to the party. Once there, they press him hard about determining if he is or isn't Dante. Erky attempts to detect his thoughts without much success, gets frustrated, slams the door and directly confronts him. Dante, knowing the gig is up, flicks the lights off and disappears. Erky casts light on a coin, but is unable to see him. He casts See Invisibility, spots him, then casts Faerie Fire on him so all can tell where he is. 

Dante informs the group that he needs to go get his parents. They've died, and he needs to bring them back. Confused, the group follows Dante back to the office and through a false wall to find a staircase to the basement. There, they find a very large mirror that they learn is called The Bridge Between. 

### The Bridge Between 
Inside the world of the mirror is a bridge. On the outside of the bridge is darkness with motes of light. Halfway across this bridge are the spirits of Dante's parents. Dante says he is always able to lead them back if he can reach them, but he must reach them before they complete the crossing of the bridge. If they cross, they will be lost forever. The tricky part, is that there are invisible barrier
