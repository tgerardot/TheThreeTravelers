## Heading to Mystara

Ted, Soren and Erky hop on the spelljammer and have Tumsy take them towards the planet Mystara in search of the tier 4 entity Dante Shadowblade. 

Doing some flyovers, they find the location in the Broken Lands where the tier 4 they are in search of likely is. It is a group of what seem to be apartment buildings and one office building just off of the shore in a town called Corunglain. The travelers decide to land on the beach.

After landing, they encounter a man heading up and down the beach with a metal detector. They ask after Dante's whereabouts and the gentleman says he never heard of him before, but he knows of a person with a similar last name. 

The group heads toward the office building and they realize that the complex of buildings is a large retirement community. They walk into the office building and there is a man behind the desk with quite an emo look about him described as "Tom Delonge, but dressed up a bit with a nice sea green polo."

The travelers enquire about the cost of the apartments/living spaces and ask to see a unit. One of the employees comes out and ask to talk to Tom and pulls him aside. Ted is able to perceive that some occupants have died in their units. Tom needs to take care of those matters, but agrees to show the travelers to a unit to look around while he attends to them. 

After getting into the unit, Erky makes his way to the bathroom mirror and casts Scrying to see what Tom is up to. He is taking care of the people in the room and casting a spell over their bodies, which turns out to be Gentle Repose. After casting the spells, he begins to head back to the party. Once there, they press him hard about determining if he is or isn't Dante. Erky attempts to detect his thoughts without much success, gets frustrated, slams the door and directly confronts him. Dante, knowing the gig is up, flicks the lights off and disappears. Erky casts light on a coin, but is unable to see him. He casts See Invisibility, spots him, then casts Faerie Fire on him so all can tell where he is. 

Dante informs the group that he needs to go get his parents. They've died, and he needs to bring them back. Confused, the group follows Dante back to the office and through a false wall to find a staircase to the basement. There, they find a very large mirror that they learn is called The Bridge Between. 

### The Bridge Between 
Inside the world of the mirror is a bridge. On the outside of the bridge is darkness with motes of light. Halfway across this bridge are the spirits of Dante's parents. Dante says he is always able to lead them back if he can reach them, but he must reach them before they complete the crossing of the bridge. If they cross, they will be lost forever. The tricky part, is that there are invisible barriers that can not be seen with See Invisibility that create a sort of invisible maze. Once a person is on the other side of one of these walls, they can not be seen and are obscured. There are also spots within the maze that when stepped on will return the stepper back to the beginning of the maze.

Additionally, any who enter the maze also summons an identical version of themselves at the opposite end. These opposites will try and kill you and have all the capabilities that of the real version.

The group begins to try and make their way through the maze and the going is slow. Ted begins to make some good progress and Soren is plowing ahead through the maze. They begin to encounter setbacks and at one point Dante is sent back to the beginning of the maze to stand right next to Erky. Erky grabs his wrist, takes an ornate doorknob from his pocket, and uses Dimension Door to teleport Dante next to his parents' spirits. They begin to follow Dante back to the mirror, but the opposites have begun to advance. 

Erky, realizing that they have the same capabilities as his friends and himself, gets a little worried about the oncoming danger and quickly teleports back to the mirror, telling the others to quickly race back. 

Ted is burning ki points to cast Wall of Fire to illuminate surrounding walls and get a better idea where they are. 

Soren dashes back the ways he came, bonking along. 

They make it back to the mirror and can see the oncoming opposites, and decide to go through the mirror after determining the opposites only exist if they are in the Between. They wait about 15 minutes for Dante to come through, but after not seeing him, they go back to the Between to see he is fighting his opposite. Erky casts Banishment on Dante's opposite and buys him enough time to get through the mirror.
