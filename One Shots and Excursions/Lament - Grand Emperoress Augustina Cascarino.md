# Heading to Lament 
Ted, Soren, Erky, and Tumsy are heading to Lament on the spelljammer. They get close, and they can see on the ship's readout that the planet is not travel advised. There is also an embargo placed upon the planet. As the ship gets closer to the planet's atmosphere, it can be seen that there are many rocks floating around it. One of those rocks flips turrets out and start shooting at The Chitchuck. Erky races to the front of the ship where Tumsy is piloting and puts his hand on the navigation and casts Shield through the ship. They make it past and into the planet's atmosphere.

Once there, they navigate towards Sanguis Pax. It is a large city, the buildings of a gothic style, and there appears to be a very large cathedral in the middle of the town. The travelers decide to land the spelljammer outside of town and walk up to the gate, which is unlocked. They make their way inside and see that the streets are completely strewn with bodies.

Erky begins to ritual cast Detect Poison & Disease as Ted takes a closer look at one of the bodies. He discerns that they are dead with no pulse, gaunt, and their appendages appear to move freely. Ted opens up the body's mouth to find fangs inside. As he moves back away from the body, the eyes flick towards Ted. These vampires appear to still be living, as much as vampires can live, but only just (6 levels of exhaustion).

Ted bleeds into a cup for the vampire and Erky asserts control over the undead in case it tries to attack. The blood only helps it recover slightly, and the travelers ask where the Emperoress resides. The vampire points towards the cathedral and they make their way in that direction. Soren is very vocal about disliking vampires and states that he has had issues with them before. It was a bad time apparently.

### Meeting Augustina Cascarino
The interior of the cathedral is very large and the group sees a large throne, one that might have been made to seat a giant, sits at the far end of the hall. Sitting in the throne is Augustina Cascarino, leaning heavily on a very VERY large greatsword, it's blade pointing to the ground. As they walk closer, the Emperoress speaks to them, although it is very evident it takes much effort to do so.

She welcomes the travelers as her guests and attempts to cast a spell. The spell is faltering, almost glitching, and Erky has seen this type of failing magic before. When wizards fall, their magic becomes unfocused and ineffective. She is attempting to cast Hero's Feast, but only manages to conjure up a loaf of bread and a ewer of water. She asks them to please eat. Erky and Soren oblige, and Ted approaches her on the throne. He asks for a rundown of what happened. 

### The option
The crew learns that the city of vampires became greedy. They used to get their food from visitors to their planet. The visitors would freely provide some of their blood. Soon, however, the vampires began to take unwillingly, trapping visitors and draining them dry. The Concordant issued an embargo on the planet, preventing any trade, which inevitably led to the starvation of the entire population. 

The travelers are presented with an option by the DM. The group can 
- Let the vampires starve. They reap what they sow
- Help them. They've made mistakes and have learned.

## Conclusion
The travelers decide to help the vampires. With their recent cruise on the river Styx, they know that there are many individuals who enjoy inflicting pain upon themselves. Perhaps they can find similarly minded individuals who would pay money in order to let the vampires take some of their blood....as long as pain was involved.
