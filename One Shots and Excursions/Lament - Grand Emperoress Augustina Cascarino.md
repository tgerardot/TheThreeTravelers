# Heading to Lament 

Ted, Soren, Erky, and Tumsy are heading to Lament on the spelljammer. They get close, and they can see on the ship's readout that the planet is not travel advised. There is also an embargo placed upon the planet. As the ship gets closer to the planet's atmosphere, it can be seen that there are many rocks floating around it. One of those rocks flips turrets out and start shooting at The Chitchuck.
