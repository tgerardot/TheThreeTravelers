# Heading to Lament 
Ted, Soren, Erky, and Tumsy are heading to Lament on the spelljammer. They get close, and they can see on the ship's readout that the planet is not travel advised. There is also an embargo placed upon the planet. As the ship gets closer to the planet's atmosphere, it can be seen that there are many rocks floating around it. One of those rocks flips turrets out and start shooting at The Chitchuck. Erky races to the front of the ship where Tumsy is piloting and puts his hand on the navigation and casts Shield through the ship. They make it past and into the planet's atmosphere.

Once there, they navigate towards Sanguis Pax. It is a large city, the buildings of a gothic style, and there appears to be a very large cathedral in the middle of the town.

### Meeting Augustina Cascarino
The interior of the cathedral is very large and the group sees a large throne, one that might have been made to seat a giant, sits at the far end of the hall. Sitting in the throne is Augustina Cascarino, leaning heavily on a very VERY large greatsword, it's blade pointing to the ground. As they walk closer, the Emperoress speaks to them, although it is very evident it takes much effort to do so.

She welcomes the travelers as her guests and attempts to cast a spell. The spell is faltering, almost glitching, and Erky has seen this type of failing magic before. When wizards fall, their magic becomes unfocused and ineffective. She is attempting to cast Hero's f
